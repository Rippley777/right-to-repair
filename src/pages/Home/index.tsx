          </h2>
          <p>
            Every year, millions of perfectly good devices are trashed because

            <strong>But not anymore.</strong> Every device you repair flips the
            bird to planned obsolescence. Every part you reuse says, “Not today,
            landfill.” Every voice raised demands a better, fairer, less
